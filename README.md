# Php-Calculators
Calculators models that I made while studying php and html

These are very basic models of calculators, but it helps me to see and follow my progress on php

basicCalculator only makes addition

betterCalculator makes all four basic operations

muchBetterCalculator it's the same as the betterCalculator but with improved design and features on the selection of the operators
